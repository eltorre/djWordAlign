# djWordAlign
Word alignment web interface using django.

Currently, nothing more than a javascript demo: https://jsfiddle.net/eltorre/0L50k4jx

Click on aligned words to delete the alignment. 

To generate new alignments, drag and drop words: if dropped on an empty space, the word gets aligned to nothing, meaning an inserted/deleted word; to do an one-to-many or many-to-many alignment, drag over all the words that take part in the alignment and drop anywhere.
